      <new><bigboldtext>What is Context?</bigboldtext></new>
      <new>Context involves the circumstances or setting in which a word appears within a text, and it is essential for determining its meaning. In SAT questions, context helps clarify the meaning of a word through surrounding text.</new>
      <new><bulletSection>
      <bullet><bold>Understanding Through Restatement:</bold> Often, SAT questions about word meaning will follow a pattern where the author makes a statement and then restates it differently. This technique helps to highlight the word’s role and meaning.</bullet>
      </bulletSection>
      <new><bold>Example for Context Understanding:</bold>
      <new>From a review of a novel: "The protagonist's journey, though fraught with peril, ultimately reveals a resilient and <bold>unyielding</bold> spirit."</new>
      <new><bold>Exercise #1:</bold> On your own, identify how 'unyielding' is used in context. Notice that it’s paired with descriptions of overcoming challenges, suggesting a meaning related to persistence and strength.</new>
      <new><bigboldtext>What is Connotation?</bigboldtext></new>
      <new>Connotation refers to the implied or suggested meanings associated with a word beyond its literal definition. Words can evoke feelings or ideas that are not explicitly stated.</new>
      <new><bold>Example for Understanding Connotation:</bold>
      <new>From a political speech: "The leader’s vision for the future was described as <bold>revolutionary</bold> by some and <bold>radical</bold> by others."</new>
      <new><bold>Exercise #2:</bold> Explore the different connotations of 'revolutionary' (often positive, suggesting major beneficial changes) versus 'radical' (can be negative, implying extreme, possibly undesirable changes). With a peer, discuss how these connotations influence the reader's understanding of the leader's vision.</new>
      <new><bigboldtext>Practical Steps to Approach Words in Context Questions</bigboldtext>
      <new><bulletSection>
      <bullet><underline>Summarize the Text:</underline> Read closely and try to paraphrase the text. Understanding the main idea is crucial because it sets the stage for interpreting individual words correctly.</bullet>
      <bullet><underline>Identify the Key Word or Phrase:</underline> Focus on the word or phrase in question by considering how it fits within the rest of the sentence or paragraph. Look for restatements or synonyms in the text that reinforce its meaning.</bullet>
      <bullet><underline>Choose the Most Appropriate Word:</underline> Consider each choice’s connotation and how it aligns with the text’s tone and content. The right choice will seamlessly integrate into the passage without altering its intended message.</bullet>

      <new><bigboldtext>Tips for SAT Success in Words for Context</bigboldtext>
      <new><bulletSection>
      <bullet><bold>Positive vs. Negative:</bold> Match the word to the overall tone of the passage. This can help quickly eliminate choices that don't fit. The overall tone (e.g., sarcastic, earnest, critical) and style of the passage can influence the meaning of words.</bullet>
      <bullet><bold>Handling Unknown Words: </bold>If you encounter a word you don't recognize, eliminate any choices that clearly don’t fit the context. From the remaining options, choose the one that best matches the passage based on the context clues.</bullet>
      <bullet><bold>Use Context Clues: </bold>Context clues can be found before or after the challenging word and help in defining or giving more insight into its meaning. Look for synonyms, antonyms, examples, or explanations within the same sentence or in adjacent sentences.</bullet>
      <bullet><bold>Context Clues Example: </bold> If the passage says, "The pandemonium in the room was palpable; everyone was shouting and nothing could be heard clearly," the words <bold>"shouting"</bold> and <bold>"nothing could be heard"</bold> help clarify that <bold>"pandemonium"</bold> refers to chaos.</bullet>
      <bullet><bold>Focus on Transition Words: </bold>Words like "however," "despite," "therefore," and "meanwhile" signal shifts in tone or continue a line of thought. These can guide you to how a word is being contrasted or built upon in the argument or narrative.</bullet>
      <bullet><bold>Transition Example: </bold>  In the sentence "He was often taciturn; however, tonight he was surprisingly loquacious," the transition <bold>"however"</bold> suggests a change in behavior, helping you infer that <bold>"loquacious"</bold> means talkative, opposite to <bold>"taciturn."</bold></bullet>
