      "Meticulous means showing great attention to detail, and it's the correct choice here. The passage describes Carson as observing subtle effects and uncovering patterns missed by others, which suggests a high level of detail and thoroughness in her observations.",
    choiceOneExplanation:
      "Answer choice A is incorrect because casual observation implies a lack of thoroughness or seriousness. Given that Carson's observations led her to write a groundbreaking book, her observations were unlikely to have been casual.",
    choiceTwoExplanation:
      'Answer choice B is the correct answer. Please look at explanation on the very top.',
    choiceThreeExplanation:
      'Answer choice C is incorrect because being indifferent means having a lack of interest or concern. This does not fit the context as Carson was deeply involved and concerned about the effects of pesticides on wildlife.',
    choiceFourExplanation:
      "Answer choice D is incorrect because sporadic implies occurrences at irregular intervals or only in a few places; scattered. Given that Carson's observations led to a groundbreaking book, it's unlikely that her observations were infrequent or irregular.",

    correctAnswerExplanation:
      "Imagine a classroom where students are working on various tasks. Each completed task earns points. Some tasks are simpler and earn 5 points each. 'Others are more involved and earn 15 points each. If a student completes a 5-point task, they earn 5 points. If they complete two of these tasks, they earn 10 points, and so on. We can represent the total points earned from the 5-point tasks as $\\text{5}$ $\\times$ $\\text{number of 5 point tasks}$ . In our equation, the number of 5-point tasks is represented by the variable $\\text{a}$ . Similarly, for the 15-point tasks, the total points earned can be represented as $\\text{15}$ $\\times$ $\\text{number of 15 point tasks}$. Here, the number of 15-point tasks is represented by the variable $\\text{b}$ . The total points for the project is 150. This total comes from a combination of the 5-point tasks and the 15-point tasks. So, the equation that sums up the total points from both types of tasks to equal 150 is: $\\text{5a + 15b = 150}$ . Now, let's examine why the other options are incorrect: ",
    choiceOneExplanation:
      'Answer choice A is the correct answer. Please look at explanation on the very top.',
    choiceTwoExplanation:
      'Answer choice B is incorrect because $\\text{15a + 5b = 150}$ suggests that the simpler tasks are worth 15 points and the more involved tasks are worth 5 points. However, this contradicts the information given.',
    choiceThreeExplanation:
      "Answer choice C is incorrect because $\\text{5a - 15b = 150}$ suggests that completing a 15-point task actually takes away, or subtracts, 15 points from the total. This doesn't make logical sense because completing a task should add points, not subtract them.",
    choiceFourExplanation:
      'Answer choice D is incorrect because $\\text{5a + b = 150}$  suggests that each of the more involved tasks is worth only 1 point, which is inconsistent with the given information that these tasks are worth 15 points each.',
